# Lyrics


<br>


**Immiscible**

[Instrumental]


<br>


**Impermanence**

Our impermanence is sacred

Our only guarantee

Wasted on soulless output

For sick societies.


<br>


We never rest, are never still

And are never fully alone.

Nature's current rudely subdued

By the highway's endless drone.


<br>


**Indifference**

Unreactive to the race

Unphased by present tense.

Power often lies

In our indifference.


<br>


Take or leave things as you may,

Or pounce and fall from grace.

Heeding desperate hunger

Is a sure way to lose face.


<br>


If I cared too much

You'd never stick around,

You've no clue what's best for you

Or those you're letting down.


<br>


Did you think good times would last?

You'd never want for gold?

Taste the pleasure while you can

And learn to let it go.


<br>


Reality is just a name

We give to strong illusions,

And oftentimes a pinch of salt

Sweetens this delusion.


<br>


Never give an inch to fear

Or let thoughts run amok.

A steady world is yours to make

Grounded like a rock.


<br>


Sometimes you don't have the answers

Time flies, and the questions never mattered.

Hard tries, and hours laid waste

We shape existence to our taste.


<br>


**Indecision**

When the night sets on a lonely road,

And you're left in the dark with your thoughts.

You've been told so many times before

Fear preys on those with fates unclear.


<br>


So make up your mind

On what you're going to do,

You've only got one life to see it through.

And push with all your might

Though the path may ebb and flow,

The light you seek could be your own.


<br>


When the cold came, I wished you here to hold

Some warmth and company in another human soul

Time and time again you test the open door

And I can't keep you back, but you're welcome here no more.


<br>


**Intranquility**

A world that's far too serious

Is cast upon our minds

For we cherish not the moment

Our consciousness entwines.


<br>


The beauty of existence

Is in how it fades away

Leaking with abandon

And fleeing by the day.


<br>


Here and now

Don't waste your time on memories or fantasies

Of pain or pleasure.


<br>


Don't drift away

The task at hand calls for your attention

And in action, you are free.


<br>


The forces of this nature

Tear and etch into the bone

The lessons of a million sunsets

Eventually hit home.


<br>


The worth of a life

Is in the fight that it puts up

And from the efforts that were made

Tranquility erupts.
