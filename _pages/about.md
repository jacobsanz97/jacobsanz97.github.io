Hi, welcome to my website!
======
-I am currently a Neuroscience MSc student at McGill University.

-I have a BSc in Honours Computer Science from McGill.

-I am interested in Neuroimaging, Big Data, Statistics (specially the Bayesian kind), and Data Reproducibility.

-I work in the [NeuroDataScience: ORIGAMI](https://neurodatascience.github.io/) and [Big Data Infrastructures for Neuroinformatics](https://big-data-lab-team.github.io) labs, under the supervision of Profs. JB Poline and Tristan Glatard.

-In my free time you'll probably find me playing guitar, recording music, or running and skipping rope.

-You can check out the music I publish on my [Spotify page](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1FfOjDCHlpzmu8VCegGAo5) (or any of the other streaming platforms).
