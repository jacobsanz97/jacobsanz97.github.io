Hi, welcome to my website!
======

* [Link to CV](https://github.com/jacobsanz97/jacobsanz97.github.io/blob/master/_pages/New%20CV.pdf)

* I am currently a Neuroscience PhD Candidate at McGill University.

* I have a BSc in Honours Computer Science from McGill.

* I am interested in Neuroimaging, Big Data Infrastructures, Machine Learning, and Data Reproducibility.

* I work in the [NeuroDataScience: ORIGAMI](https://neurodatascience.github.io/) and [Big Data Infrastructures for Neuroinformatics](https://big-data-lab-team.github.io) labs, under the supervision of Profs. JB Poline and Tristan Glatard.

* In my free time you'll probably find me playing guitar, recording/producing music, or working out.

* You can check out the music I publish on my [Spotify page](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1FfOjDCHlpzmu8VCegGAo5) (or most of the other streaming platforms).
