# Lyrics

**A Damn Good Thrashing**

[Instrumental]


<br>


**Rules**

The reason rules exist is to be broken

To evolve through challenges outspoken

To be taken case by case, free of dogma

The rule should serve the man, and not vice-versa.


<br>


Progress, as defined, cannot be static

Or illusory control for the fanatic.

Boundaries should be questioned and transcended

In pursuit of truth, no walls shall be defended.


<br>


**Get It Right** *(written and recorded with Yujing Zou)*

Never know how your day is gonna go when you're starting it
Seems too slow, Getting nowhere with your endless goals


<br>


Pressure's building up feeling something's gonna blow
Facing my own limits but here we go


<br>


Push with all your might (you do)
Try to get it right (you lose)
It doesn't work sometimes (can't choose)
It costs your peace of mind


<br>


Feeling low, but I know what is down
Must come up again


<br>


It goes to show
Everything is in a state of constant change


<br>


Pressure's building up feeling something's gonna blow
Facing my own limits but here we go

**No Hill Seems Worthy**

No hill seems worthy to make my stand

But if I don't climb, I'll sink in quicksand.

Does any hill even matter, seeing they're so small?

Relative to the cosmic scale of it all?


<br>


The hills around here start to look much the same

And time starts to play strange tricks on my brain.

Novelty calls, but routine whips

Time for a change, teach this old dog new tricks.


<br>


I'm moving much too slowly

While life passes fast

I know, I know it's only natural

That all things must pass.


<br>


It's fine the days are passing

But not they pass me by

The days - like the hills - start blending

Beneath the vast sky.


<br>


Nothing much changes, inside these confines

Same old thoughts in the same old mind

Increasingly complex in fractal design

But I can't change the seed, no matter how I try.


<br>


I know that I'm free, but I can't seem to run

I've become entangled in this web that I've spun.

Is the script at hand being written or read?

Is there room for a twist somewhere ahead?


<br>


**Respite**

Belief in superscience

To halt the setting sun

Some say it doesn't matter

'In the end, all fates are one'.


<br>


Leap out the open window,

The proverbial sink or swim.

Are we turning an inflection?

Can we ever truly win?


<br>


Take a deep breath, for now, we're all right.

I've got you nearby; it's all that matters tonight.


<br>


Close your eyes and surrender to light.

Hold you in my arms; it's a dream and respite.


<br>


The clouds are dark and heavy,

And the world shall turn no more.

Or so the news will tell you

If you let them keep the score.


<br>


Dirty rain pours down the gutters,

Occupies my space to breathe.

Deadlines, bills, endless opinionsâ€”

We've built a cage of needs.


<br>


**Colours**

The bright colours of childhood

Wash away with the years

Smeared as if by the friction of time

New hues often appear.


<br>


Emerging from our cocoon

Pressures build and rise

The fall is ever-higher

But we never reach the sky


<br>


Colour is defiance

Towards the unyielding void.

A statement by the painter

Marking the passions deployed.


<br>


In worthy effort and investment

Colours intensify.

Facing the final curtain call,

With darkness they entwine.


<br>


**The Educated Ape**

The educated ape likes numbers and words

They're a great source of comfort when life is absurd

We model the world but we often forget

That wisdom's true measure lies beyond intellect.


<br>


We over-rely on external validation

from studies and gods, and friends and relations.

Yet we firmly ignore our gut intuition

The quest for truth ignores self-recognition.


<br>


Is it because the ape is lazy?

Or does the ape fear being called 'crazy'?

Have rules and schooling dulled its instincts?

...Conforming to its precincts.


<br>


Most of perception, we cannot encode

While a world of deception is written and sold,

So the ape must learn to trust its own sense,

Ignoring the noise that corrupts inference.


<br>


Numbers and words: they are but a tool

We must learn them well or risk being fooled.

They can help us dig, or serve us poorly

As we search for the truth in our story.


<br>


**Fragility**

'Life is but a moment'

The philosopher proclaimed

As his hairs turned grey

In the mirror he portrayed.


<br>


Ashes to ashes scattered

Cleared swiftly by the winds,

While humanity reprieves itself

In the name of holy sin.


<br>


Fragility of all we love

Is revealed in sudden shocks

Yet we all live to regret

Gratitude under lock.


<br>


Then the old fuckers in a suit

Send the young to die in war

And cleverly design a way

To further tax the poor.


<br>


Common sense is oddly rare,

But it's clear to all who think

We've not a clue what's going on

And we're lucky not to sink.


<br>


The echoes of eternity

Are thunder through our veins

We think that we're invincible

..'Til the master pulls the reins.
