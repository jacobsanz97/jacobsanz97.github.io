# Lyrics

**A Damn Good Thrashing**

[Instrumental]

**Rules**

The reason rules exist is to be broken
To evolve through challenges outspoken
To be taken case by case, free of dogma
The rule should serve the man, and not vice-versa.

Progress, as defined, cannot be static
Or illusory control for the fanatic.
Boundaries should be questioned and transcended
In pursuit of truth, no walls shall be defended.

**Get It Right** *(written and recorded with Yujing Zou)*



**No Hill Seems Worthy**

No hill seems worthy to make my stand
But if I don't climb, I'll sink in quicksand.
Does any hill even matter, seeing they're so small?
Relative to the cosmic scale of it all?

The hills around here start to look much the same
And time starts to play strange tricks on my brain.
Novelty calls, but routine whips
Time for a change, teach this old dog new tricks.

I'm moving much too slowly
While life passes fast
I know, I know it's only natural
That all things must pass.

It's fine the days are passing
But not they pass me by
The days - like the hills - start blending
Beneath the vast sky.

Nothing much changes, inside these confines
Same old thoughts in the same old mind
Increasingly complex in fractal design
But I can't change the seed, no matter how I try.

I know that I'm free, but I can't seem to run
I've become entangled in this web that I've spun.
Is the script at hand being written or read?
Is there room for a twist somewhere ahead?

**Respite**



**Colours**

The bright colours of childhood
Wash away with the years
Smeared as if by the friction of time
New hues often appear.

Emerging from our cocoon
Pressures build and rise
The fall is ever-higher
But we never reach the sky

Colour is defiance
Towards the unyielding void.
A statement by the painter
Marking the passions deployed.

In worthy effort and investment
Colours intensify.
Facing the final curtain call,
With darkness they entwine.

**The Educated Ape**

**Fragility**
